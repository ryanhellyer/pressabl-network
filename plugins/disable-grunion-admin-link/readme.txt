The <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/grunion-contact-form/">Grunion Contact Form plugin</a> for WordPress is one of the best contact form plugins around. It is far simpler to use than it’s more popular rivals such as Contact Form 7 and Gravity Forms and is used by the largest WordPress powered website of them all, WordPress.com.

<strong>However</strong> … some of you may not like the addition of an extra link in your WordPress admin menu which this new version includes. So to avoid this problem, you can simply install the “Disable Grunion Admin link” plugin to have that extra admin menu link replaced with a less obtrusive one which can be found under "Dashboard".
