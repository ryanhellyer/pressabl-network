To replicate the <a href="#">Lasse Super demo site</a>, follow these instructions ... 

1. Create pages for each section you wish to add to your home page.
2. To set background images for each page, add new images under "Background image" on the page editing panel.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I edit the content on the front page? =

The content on the front page is controlled via static pages. Simply find the static page in WordPress corresponding to the page you wish to modify, and edit that page. Your changes will appear on the front page.

= How do I change the order of the content on the front page =

The order of the content matches the order of the navigation menu. Simply edit the 'primary' menu to change the front page content order.

= Why do the static pages redirect to the home page? =

This is an intentional feature of this theme. The design was intended to display your pages on the front page, not as individual pages. Exceptions to this, include search pages and all blog related pages.

= How do I create a blog? =

This theme is mostly intended for static page only websites, but you can add a blog easily by setting up WordPress to use a static page as the blog. Then when you add that blog page to your sites menu, that page will link directly to the blog.

= Is this theme suitable as a blog only theme =

This theme includes blog functionality in case you feel it is necessary, but it was designed with the intention of being used as a portfolio type theme for static pages.

= Who designed and coded the theme? =

The theme was created in-house at <strong><a href="http://metronet.no/">Metronet in Oslo, Norway</a></strong>. <a href="http://lasseolsen.com/">Lasse Olsen</a> did the design work and the coding was completed by <a href="http://pixopoint.com/">Ryan Hellyer</a>.
